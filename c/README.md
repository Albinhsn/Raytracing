## Notes from second pass 

## Chapter 4
* A line in which you can only go in one direction is called either a half-line or a ray
### Three steps of a ray tracer
    1. Calculate the ray from the "eye" through the pixel
    2. Determine which objects the ray intersects
    3. Compute a color for the closest intersection point

* The point from which all rays originate is called the eye point
